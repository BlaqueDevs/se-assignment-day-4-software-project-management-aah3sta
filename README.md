## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is flexible and iterative, allowing quick changes while waterfall follows a linear process with fixed stages. Agile adapts easily but can be unpredictable, while Waterfall is structured but less flexible.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile suits projects requiring frequent updates, like mobile apps. Waterfall is better for well-defined projects, like banking systems.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for ensuring quality standards include testing, code reviews, and continuous integration. High standards improve reliability and user trust.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope defines boundaries and prevents scope creep. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) organizes tasks into smaller, manageable parts, aiding planning.

A detailed schedule improves efficiency and resource management. Gantt charts visually track progress and dependencies.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Your software should address a specific pain point, like improving productivity or automating tasks, making life easier for users.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A clear problem definition guides solution development, ensuring the software meets real user needs effectively.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Describe your software in a simple and engaging way, focusing on its purpose and benefits rather than technical details.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Highlight unique features, such as automation, user-friendly design, or integration with other tools

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Market size and growth potential can be assessed using industry reports, surveys, and competitor analysis.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
